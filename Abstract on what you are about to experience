# Hello Everyone!!
This is our team!!
Cicida 3301
Glad to see you here!!

We are here with our idea to create an application software to help user get
information about cars (which has now become the necessity nowadays for many
of the people) that suits their necessity and budget plus can get the information
at just one platform by just tapping some keys on their keyboards.We here try to
give technical information about the car which is given rarely to them which is of
keen interest to the buyer who has some technical knowledge of all those aspects.
They try to find it on wikipedia or just google it to get some technical
information.But you know its very time consuming.So we try to give the
information at just one platform.With very less to no efforts.Its a platform
where one can buy new car or second hand car or can even put his/her old car for
sale.We try to solve out all the problems faced by buyer while buying a car in
this application by using C++ as our language to execute the task as it is very
common language and can be run on any platform.We have added the graphics
of a car to make it attractive and to maintain the interest of user.Firstly we
have asked buyer to create an I’d so that it would be easier for us to contact the
buyer if he/she is interested in any particular car.And then stored the data in
one file so that the user can login using his I,d.Then we asked the user for
what purpose he is using this application:For buying second hand car or for
buying new car or for selling the old one.If he desires to buy a new car,then we
asked the user to apply some filters for price or the company.We have kept the
filters to be mandatory.They can be kept optional also.Like if one desires he can
otherwise its Ok.At present we have added two filters only we can add some
more to the original application after collecting some more information about the
cars and can sort them out according to no of seats,availability of sunroof
etc.Then after asking for the filters,showed him the information that we stored
in our “txt” files about the cars as per their desires.We have asked for one
option in each filter part.We can ask for more options by using do while
loop.And we can further ask the user if he is interested if yes then we can reply
to him that we will share the information soon at their mail I’d about the
availability of that car at most nearest place to them by first asking them for
their location or by tracking their location using GPRS system and we will give
information about trusted showrooms only that are connected to us so that he may
not suffer any trouble or keep it as a premium version part.We have not added
it as its just a prototype.If he desires to buy a second hand car we showed the
information about the cars that are available.We have added just a little
information about the car and honor,more information can be added to enhance
the honesty in deal. Filters can be applied to that also like which company or
what price range do you want??Then we asked the user whether he is interested
or not if yes we gave user the contact no of seller.We can keep that also to the
premium version part and can add some more personal information about the
user like business terms with us,address,location etc.If the user is interested in
selling his old car,we ask him to give information about the car and himself.We
asked about little bit info but we can ask about technical details also.his address
and some more personal information.Then as it is a well known fact that nobody
is completely perfect.We asked the user if he desires to give us some feedback or
remark where we are good and where there is need of improvement.It gives user
the view that this application is more frank than others and hence is more trust
worthy.And it gives us also the points that a common person expects from an
application and can make it more user friendly.

We can add the pictures also with the car information as look matters a lot for
a common person and it gives the user the view that this is really the app where
I can see all information and can take my decision easily.Its a kind of software
which is needed by almost everyone as there comes at least one moment in our life
where we desires to buy a car the one for which we had ever dreamed for!And
the moment can be made more precious and sweet one by giving the information
in one go and by giving trust worthy deals.
Thanks for your patience!!

Thanks for reading our work!!
HAVE A NICE DAY!!
